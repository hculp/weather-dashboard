## Description

This is a weather dashboard created using openweathermap APIs. The APIs used are the Current and 5 day Forecast. When a user searches with a city name, then the current and future five day forecast conditions are displayed for that city. The city is then added to the search history. For each weather conditions displayed, the city name, date, icon of weather confition, temperature, humidity, and wind speed for both current weather and 5 day forecast. When a user clicks on a city from the search history, the current and future weather conditions display for that city. When a user clears the search history, then all prior searches are removed and the weather conditions are emptied and hidden from display.
